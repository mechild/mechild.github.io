2.	A brief description of your Github account.
   This Github account is the same one I used in my previous degree for web building and it's the one I will be continuing to use for this class as well. 
4.	A brief description of the repository you created.
   The repository I created was made in order to store my files for this class, CTI-110-0004.
5.	A brief description of the steps you took to clone the repository onto your local machine
To clone my repository I started with the repository I had already and once I had the desktop app downloaded and logged I located the original repository I made. Then I chose the clone repository option that appeared when I seleceted my desired repository and when prompted chose where I wanted to save it.
